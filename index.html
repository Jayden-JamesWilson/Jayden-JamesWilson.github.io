    <p>Anyway my name is Jayden-James Wilson. My passion and possible future carrer will be in 
    programming, that consisting of Web Development and Application Development. I started to code when 
    i was about 14 years old, back when Covid-19 was spreading like wildfire! I was bored and wanted to do 
    something fun and i found that coding is one of those things. The fact i can come up with an idea and make 
    it a reality, to me is AMAZING! </p>
